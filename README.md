# Anime site

An anime site inspired by anichart.net, pulling from several APIs; built with React, NodeJs, Express Webpack, &amp; Emotion.

Keep up to date on the latest Anime!

I wanted to try a different method of hosting other than Firebase, so I chose Heroku.

As I am using Herokus free tier and it's not a site with a lot of visitors, it might take a while to load up on your first visit.

It now automatically takes you to the page showing the current season depending on the current month.

It will also update the years as well so if you visit in 2021, it will show you the 2021 anime.
